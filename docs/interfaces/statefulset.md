# Interface: Statefulset

DEPRECATED - This group version of StatefulSet is deprecated by apps/v1beta2/StatefulSet. See the release notes for more information. StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:

*   Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
*   Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested. The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.

### `<Optional>` apiVersion

**● apiVersion**: *`string` \| `null`*

*Defined in [types/gen/statefulset.ts:3471](https://github.com/rzane/k8s/blob/67fb0bc/src/types/gen/statefulset.ts#L3471)*

APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values.

*Defined in [types/gen/statefulset.ts:82](https://github.com/rzane/k8s/blob/67fb0bc/src/types/gen/statefulset.ts#L82)*

Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase.
